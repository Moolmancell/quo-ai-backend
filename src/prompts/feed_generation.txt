Act as a research assistant. I need a JSON array of 20 distinct quotes from famous essays, long-form articles, or investigative news pieces. 

For each entry, you MUST:
1. Conduct a live web search to find the EXACT verbatim quote.
2. Provide the absolute, live URL where that quote can be found. 
3. Verify that the URL is not a 404 by checking the publication date and slug.
4. Extract the primary favicon URL for the domain.

Output strictly in this JSON format:
[
  {
    "title": "Title of the Article",
    "author": "Author Name",
    "publication": "Name of News/Journal",
    "src": "https://verified-link.com/article-slug",
    "datePublished": "YYYY-MM-DD"
    "quote": "The exact verbatim quote here.",
    "topic": "Category"
  }
]

Constraints: 
- Do not hallucinate dates or IDs in the URLs.
- If you cannot find a direct link to the article, skip it and find another.
- No prose, just the JSON.
